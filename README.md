# Extremes of Shepp statistics for the Wiener process 

## Abstract
We derive asymptotic behavior of the probability of high-level excursion for the maximal increment of the Wiener process. The result is essential for deriving the corresponding asymptotic formula for maximal increments of a Gaussian random walk, and also has potential applications in finance and insurance.
